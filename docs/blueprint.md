## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep Indigo (#3F51B5) for a sense of trust and authority. Its depth ensures readability while maintaining a professional aesthetic.
- Background color: Very light gray (#F0F2F5), derived from the indigo hue but almost fully desaturated, providing a clean, neutral backdrop that emphasizes content and UI elements.
- Accent color: Muted Violet (#9575CD) to create contrast with key actions and interactive elements without overwhelming the interface. Its harmonious blend with the primary indigo supports a cohesive user experience.
- Body font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif with a modern, machined, objective, neutral look, ideal for ensuring legibility and a professional feel across all panels.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk', a sans-serif which, used with Inter, provides a modern contrast. It evokes a computerized, techy, scientific vibe.
- Maintain consistent spacing across all three panels, creating an uncluttered and visually appealing layout that enhances the user experience.
- Use smooth transitions for page navigations, providing a seamless, engaging experience as users move through the platform.
